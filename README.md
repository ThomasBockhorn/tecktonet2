# Tecktonet.com main website 2.0

## Introduction

Tecktonet 2.0 is a completely refreshed version of the original website Tecktonet.com.  I wanted this website to have the capablity of more advanced blogging features.  This website also has a refreshed front.  Instead of a static image, I used a template that offered an automatated image that shows a cursor.  I have also introduced a better backend for blogging and project creation.  As for blogging, html styling are now accepted so now blogs are more readable.  I have also allowed for category for projects.  Visitors can now sort through different categories to see the various projects I build.

## Requirements

Tecktonet 2.0  will not longer support older Internet Explorer browsers.  All modern browsers should be able to see my site.

## future features

Some up and coming features will include visitor comments to blog posts.  I want to also add comments to projects as well.  At some point, I want to add google anaylic graphs in the backend so I can see how the website is doing.
