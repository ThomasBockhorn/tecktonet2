                <p>Hi</p>
                <br>
                <p> Building websites are fun and challanging. Websites can also be creative endevors that inspire. </p>
                <br>
                <p> I first got into web development with an invitation by Udacity including a nice Google scholarship
                    for their front-end web development program. After taking a few lessions, I became hooked on all
                    things web development. To further my education, I took and continue to take Udemy courses for both
                    front-end and back-end development. The beauty of both technical and asthetic spheres and how they
                    interacted together fascinated me. Just like architecture, good websites need to consider both form
                    and function.</p>
                <br>
                <p> My other source of inspiration is history and the art of telling stories. I received a Master degree
                    in history. Good historical narratives and websites share how important the central theme is and how
                    essential the human connection is. History and websites can be dry and boring, or can be interesting
                    and compelling. It all depends on the content. I try to make compelling websites that garner
                    viewer's attention.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Let me help you build a website that will keep bringing in vistors, that will provide a compelling
                    narrative, that will be easy for a vistor to use, and that will be clean and asthetically pleasing.
                    Let's build a website that you can be proud of.</p>
                <br>
